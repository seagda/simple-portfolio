  <h1>Just When I Thought I Was Out...</h1>

<p>I'm not quite as old as dirt, but I've been working in web development since 1995. I never became Bill Gates, but I did drop out of college, went to work for a tech company, and moved to San Francisco. When that company went public, a best friend and I used our funds to start our own agency, Floor 9 Interactive.</p>
  
<p>For five years, we self-funded entirely through sales and operations. We cut our tech teeth on buildling online promotions for clients including AT&T and Intel, custom websites for banks and insurance companies, databases for biotech startups, and early e-commerce initiatives for clients such as the Christian Science Monitor.  After we closed Floor 9, I joined the training department of an enterprise software company, which was bought by IBM.</p>
  
<p>But 2005 was a different world, Git, ES6, and AGILE hadn't been invited, and tech jobs that offered remote work were the rarity rather than the norm. Burned out, I left technology and went back to school. I've studied oil painting and printmaking, graphic design, community organizing, adult education, editing and publishing, media studies, business writing and organizational communications... all while "fooling around" with poetry and websites.</p>
  
<p>Over fifteen years, I earned two degrees from University of Massachusetts Boston in creative writing, while focusing professionally in online education as well as writing across the curriculum for three Boston colleges in Boston: UMass Boston, Mass Art and Northeastern.  The greatest honor of my life to date has been helping hundreds of students advance their own lives while trying to figure out my own.</p>
  
<p>As you'll see from my resume, my path hasn't followed a straight and narrow trajectory... though somehow, I've always ended up being "the tech guy" at every job since my first. Being interdisciplinary has taught me the value of systems thinking and collaboration, and the evolution of full-stack web development has at last "pulled me back in." It's an amazing time to work into technology, and our world has a lot of problems to solve.</p> 
<h3>Let's get to it!</h3>
